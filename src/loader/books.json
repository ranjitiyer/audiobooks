{"id": 47, "title": "count of monte cristo", "description": "The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re. It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas's most popular work. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815\u20131838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story.

{"id": 53, "title": "bleak house", "description": "Bleak House is the ninth novel by Charles Dickens, published in 20 monthly parts between March 1852 and September 1853. It is widely held to be one of Dickens' finest and most complete novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. Dickens tells all of these both through the narrative of the novel's heroine, Esther Summerson, and as an omniscient narrator. Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole. The plot concerns a long-running legal dispute (Jarndyce and Jarndyce) which has far-reaching consequences for all involved.

{"id": 55, "title": "this side of paradise", "description": "This Side of Paradise is the debut novel of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Published in 1920, and taking its title from a line of the Rupert Brooke poem Tiare Tahiti, the book examines the lives and morality of post-World War I youth. Its protagonist, Amory Blaine, is a wealthy and attractive Princeton University student who dabbles in literature and has a series of romances that eventually lead to his disillusionment. In his later novels, Fitzgerald would further develop the book's theme of love warped by greed and status-seeking.

{"id": 59, "title": "adventures of huckleberry finn", "description": "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) by Mark Twain is one of the truly great American novels, beloved by children, adults, and literary critics alike.  The book tells the story of \u201cHuck\u201d Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer\u2019s sidekick in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft.  Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.\nAs Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures.  The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim.  A constant theme throughout the book is Huck\u2019s internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn\u2019t possibly be wrong to help him.\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set.  Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children\u2019s book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, as Twain wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn it progressed into a more serious work.  Twain\u2019s views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn.  The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to The American Library Association it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.(Summary by Annie Coleman)", "num_sections": 47, "sections": {"0": {"number": 0, "name": "Ch. 1", "url": "https://ia600207.us.archive.org/34/items/huck_finn_librivox/huckfinn_01_twain_apc_64kb.mp3"}, "1": {"number": 1,

{"id": 65, "title": "odyssey", "description": "The Odyssey is one of the two major ancient Greek epic poems (the other being the Iliad), attributed to the poet Homer. The poem is commonly dated to between 800 and 600 BC. The poem is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek hero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after the fall of Troy.\n\nIt takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus' home to compete for Penelope's hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.\n\nThe poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to be read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.

A culmination of the medieval world-view of the afterlife, it establishes the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the Italian standard, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. - The Divine Comedy is composed of three canticas (or \"cantiche\") \u2014 Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise) \u2014 composed each of 33 cantos (or \"canti\"). The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100. - The poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.

She was a sickly child, however, while she was travelling she was almost always healthy. Her first trip, in 1854, took her to America, visiting relatives. Her first book, The Englishwoman in America was published anonymously two years later.\nUnbeaten Tracks in Japan is compiled of the letters she sent to her sister during her 7 months sojourn in Japan in 1878. Her travels there took her from Edo (now called Tokyo) through the interior - where she was often the first foreigner the locals had met - to Niigata, and from there to Aomori. There she crossed over to Yezo (Hokkaido), and her account on the life of the Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, provides an interesting glimpse of days long past.

Stowe was a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist. The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the North\u2019s view of slavery. In fact, when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, President Lincoln is said to have commented, \u201cSo you\u2019re the little lady whose book started the Civil War.\u201d First published on March 20, 1852, the story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters\u2014both fellow slaves and slave owners\u2014revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.

Throughout the twists and turns of his escapades and adventures Ranald learns from his father the important lessons of courage and integrity.When Ranald Bannerman's Boyhood came out in 1871 the New York Independent praised it as \"full of sweetness, full of boy-life and true goodness\". Perhaps, but it is also a good story, from the master of storytellers.

The book in which he originally offered to the world his interpretation of dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to be pondered over by scientists at their leisure, not to be assimilated in a few hours by the average alert reader. In those days, Freud could not leave out any detail likely to make his extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptable to those willing to sift data. - Freud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which the reading of his magnum opus imposed upon those who have not been prepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and he abstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute the essential of his discoveries.\nThe publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting to the reading public the gist of Freud's psychology in the master's own words, and in a form which shall neither discourage beginners, nor appear too elementary to those who are more advanced in psychoanalytic study. - Dream psychology is the key to Freud's works and to all modern psychology. With a simple, compact manual such as Dream Psychology there shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the most revolutionary psychological system of modern times.

Her early advocacy of women's equality and her attacks on conventional femininity and the degradation of women presaged the later emergence of the feminist political movement.

{"id": 85, "title": "consolation of philosophy", "description": "Consolation of Philosophy (Latin: Consolatio Philosophiae) is a philosophical work by Boethius written in about the year 524 AD. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West in medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, and is also the last great work that can be called Classical.  Consolation of Philosophy was written during Boethius' one year imprisonment while awaiting trial, and eventual horrific execution, for the crime of treason by Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome and was brought down by treachery. It was from this experience he was inspired to write a philosophical book from prison reflecting on how a lord's favor could change so quickly and why friends would turn against him. It has been described as \u201cby far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen.\u201d  The Consolation of Philosophy stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the heathen philosophy of Seneca the Younger and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by Thomas Aquinas. The book is heavily influenced by Plato and his dialogues (as was Boethius himself).

{"id": 88, "title": "mrs. caudle's curtain lectures", "description": "Douglas William Jerrold (1803-1857) was the son of an actor manager. After some time in the Navy and as an apprentice printer he became a playwright and later a journalist. He was a contemporary and friend of Charles Dickens. As a journalist he worked for Punch magazine in which Mrs Caudle's Curtain Lectures were serialised, to be published in book form in 1846.Job Caudle, the 'hero' of the book is a Victorian shopkeeper whose wife finds she can only talk to him without interruption in bed. Caudle, who outlives his wife, finds he can no longer sleep easily because of his memory of these 'lectures' and resolves to exorcise his wife's memory by recording the lectures, it seems with a view to future publication for the edification of others. Jerrold's humour shines through this insight into Victorian middle class culture.

{"id": 94, "title": "wind in the willows", "description": "This much-loved story follows a group of animal friends in the English countryside as they pursue adventure \u2026 and as adventure pursues them! The chief characters - Mole, Rat, and Toad - generally lead upbeat and happy lives, but their tales are leavened with moments of terror, homesickness, awe, madcap antics, and derring-do.\nAlthough classed as children\u2019s literature, The Wind in the Willows holds a gentle fascination for adults too. The vocabulary is decidedly not \u201cDick and Jane\u201d, and a reader with a love of words will find new ones to treasure, even if well-equipped for the journey. Parents will appreciate the themes of loyalty, manners, self-restraint, and comradeship which are evident throughout the book. When the characters err, they are prompt to acknowlege it, and so a reading of this book can model good behavior to children, who will otherwise be enchanted with the many ways in which the lives of these bucolic characters differ from modern life.\nThis book was so successful that it enabled the author to retire from banking and take up a country life somewhat like that of his creations. It has been adapted for screen, stage, and even a ride at the original Disneyland.\n(Summary by Mark F.

{"id": 97, "title": "lord jim", "description": "A classic of early literary modernism, Lord Jim tells the story of a young \"simple and sensitive character\" who loses his honor in a display of cowardice at sea -- and of his expiation of that sin against his own \"shadowy ideal of conduct\" on the remote island of Patusan. The novel, written by Conrad for magazine serialization during an intense and chaotic ten months in 1899 and 1900, has, in the words of Thomas C.

He operates with his \"seven score\" (140 strong) group of fellow outlawed yeomen \u2013 named the Merry Men. He and his band are usually associated with Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire.The Victorian era generated its own distinct versions of Robin Hood. The traditional tales were often adapted for children, most notably in Howard Pyle's Merry Adventures of Robin Hood.

She was one of the earliest novelists ever to use dialect in her works, finding often that no word but the vernacular would suffice to convey the meaning she wanted to achieve. She was the author of The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, a much-acclaimed and sometimes-reviled biography of her friend and peer.Wives and Daughters revolves around Molly Gibson, only daughter of a widowed doctor living in a provincial English town in the 1830s. The novel was first published in the Cornhill Magazine as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. When Mrs Gaskell died suddenly in 1865, it was not quite complete, and the last section was written by Frederick Greenwood.

{"id": 120, "title": "three musketeers", "description": "The Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re. It recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer. D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis -- inseparable friends who live by the motto, \"One for all, and all for one\".\nThe Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the magazine Le Si\u00e8cle between March and July 1844. Dumas claimed it was based on manuscripts he had discovered in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. It was later proven that Dumas had based his work on the book M\u00e9moires de Monsieur D'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la premi\u00e8re compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister D'Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700). \nDumas' version of the story covers the adventures of D'Artagnan and his friends from 1625 to 1628, as they are involved in intrigues involving the weak King Louis XIII of France, his powerful and cunning advisor Cardinal Richelieu, the beautiful Queen Anne of Austria, her English lover, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and the Siege of La Rochelle. Adding to the intrigue are the mysterious Milady de Winter, and Richelieu's right-hand man, the Comte de Rochefort.

{"id": 141, "title": "connecticut yankee in king arthur's court", "description": "\nCome and hear the strange tail of The Boss Hank Morgan, a modern day (at the time of publication) Connecticut Yankee who inexplicably finds himself transported to the court of the legendary King Arthur (as the title of the book implies). Hank, or simply, The Boss, as he comes to be most frequently known, quickly uses his modern day knowledge and education to pass himself off as a great magician, to get himself out of all sorts of surprising, (and frequently amusing) situations, as well as to advance the technological and cultural status of the nation in which he finds himself.\n\n\nIn the rather un-subtle sub-text of the story, Twain uses The Boss to express a surprisingly pragmatic and frequently contradictory philosophy. The Boss explores the relative merits of Democracy, and Monarchy, he expresses his views on the \u201cNature v. Nurture\u201d debate, he frequently speaks forcefully against an established Church, but just as strongly advocates for religion and a variety of churches (just not a compulsory one) and he devotes at least one afternoon to introducing his companions to the concept of inflation. In a far more subtle, yet no less forceful manner, the Boss shares with the reader some views about taxation, slavery (both literal and wage slavery), trade unions, the origins of the German language, the nature of marriage, and probably most powerfully, death.\n\n\nIt is a tall order for a relatively brief text, but Twain manages it all with surprising clarity. No one will agree fully with the Boss on all of these matters, and I would be surprised if Twain himself would. In fact the Boss\u2019s views are so pragmatic, and often contradictory, the reader is left to wonder if Twain himself is alternately speaking through the Boss, and setting him up as a straw man. Either way it is a delightful story and a great piece of American Literature, to say nothing of an excellent argument for education.\n\n(Review written by Steve Andersen)\n", "num_sections": 45,

Far more than mere tales to amuse children, they passed along the collective wisdom of the tribes.

Though these stories were recast as children\u2019s fairy tales in the 1920s, they contain much of the old wisdom of a culture which has largely disappeared.

{"id": 147, "title": "art and heart", "description": "This special poetry collection was assembled to celebrate the first anniversary of the creation of LibriVox. LibriVox volunteers bring you 38 different recordings of Art and Heart, by Ella Wheeler Wilcox. This poem, originally suggested by Betsie Bush, was chosen for this special collection due to a general concensus that the message of the poem corresponds with the spirit of LibriVox.\n\nThe poem asserts that, \u201cIt is not art, but heart, that wins the wide world over.\u201d And so it is with LibriVox: it is not only the books, the poetry, the literature that make LibriVox what it is; but it is also the people, the diversity of voices, and all of the different lives and experiences that affect the way a person reads a piece of text. The art is the foundation of LibriVox, but the many hearts behind it are the true essence and spirit of LibriVox.\n\nFor more information on the the first anniversary of LibriVox, and to hear a one hour special audio program featuring interviews, bloopers, and samplers, please visit the Anniversary homepage: http://librivox.org/librivox-anniversary-2006/", "num_sections": 38, "sections": {"0": {"number": 0, "name": "Art and Heart -

They are, in effect, Ezra Pound\u2019s English translations/interpretations from notebooks written by the Japanese scholar Ernest Fenollosa. Pound, not knowing any Chinese or Japanese at all, promptly created a new and somewhat complex style of translation, as he had done with words from several other languages. The Cathay poems are primarily written by the Chinese poet Li Po, refered to throughout these translations as Rihaku, the Japanese form of his name. These poems came to have a profound influence on 20th Century poetry, spawning, among other things, the Imagist movement, and helped in the generation of widespread interest in Asian literature and thought. Also included in this collection are two poems from Pound\u2019s 1912 collection Ripostes. \u201cThe Seafarer\u201d is another of Pound\u2019s experiments in translation, this one from the Anglo-Saxon.

{"id": 168, "title": "secret chambers and hiding places", "description": "\u201cSecret Chambers and Hiding Places\u201d is a collection of concealments and their uses, almost all within England, although a very few passages and chambers in continental Europe are mentioned, Jacobite hidey holes in Scotland, while the final chapter of the book covers Bonnie Prince Charlie\u2019s wanderings around Scotland, among caves and other hiding places. Most chapters are devoted to historical events; such as the the seventeenth century persecution of roman catholics (with many large houses having specially constructed \u201cpriests\u2019 holes\u201d), or various unpopular monarchs and their hiding places. The text is scattered with legends and true stories, with occasional skeletons found, still hiding, long centuries after the searchers have left. The author describes hidden doors, passages, rooms and pits with enormous enthusiasm \u2026 and with considerable regret when he has to describe secret places lost to demolition or modernisation.

{"id": 169, "title": "death be not proud", "description": "    This week we\u2019re marking the American Memorial Day with eleven readings of a John Donne poem. Memorial Day was conceived as a time to remember military men and women who had lost their lives in war. Kings and presidents come and go and some of the reasons that wars have come about are now lost from memory or are obscured in our history texts.\n\n    A consistent aspect of war is that those who fight them are not those who arrange them. The soldiers and sailors who suffer loss of limb, scarred minds or forfeit their lives mostly come from the lower and middle rungs of our societal ladder. They are our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters.\n\n    Once gone, it is the family who notices the empty chair at the family table while society at large knows not their name. Death has captured them and taken them forever from our midst. It has become personal and not a vague philosophical idea. The theme of Donne\u2019s poem is that, though Death is irresistible, it has no cause to be proud. The human spirit and its hope for redemption is indomitable.

{"id": 184, "title": "history of england, from the accession of james ii - (volume 1, chapter 05)", "description": "This chapter of Macaulay\u2019s, History of England is concerned, for a large part, with insurrection against James II and his manoeuverings to suppress these. Argyle has been sheltering in Holland and returns to raise an army against James. Although brave and quick witted, he was no leader of men and the army became a confused rabble and were dispersed. Argyle was captured and died bravely. Monmouth had also been sheltering in Holland and he landed at Lyme and declared himself king on 20th June 1685. He was defeated at the battle of Sedgemoor and eventually caught and executed. Monmouth is a fine romantic and of course ultimately tragic figure.

{"id": 208, "title": "on the antiseptic principle of the practice of surgery", "description": " Joseph Lister was born near London in 1827. He studied medicine at the University of London and pursued a career as a surgeon in Scotland. He became professor of Surgery in Glasgow and later (1877) at Kings College Hospital, in London.    Lister\u2019s contribution to the advancement of surgery cannot be overestimated. Before his work on antisepsis, wounds were often left open to heal, leading to long recoveries, unsightly scarring, and not infrequently amputation or death due to infection. Lister\u2019s work enabled more wounds to be closed primarily with sutures, drastically reducing healing time, scarring, amputations, and deaths due to infection.    Lister retired in 1896 but was called back to assist in the operation on King Edward VII for appendicitis just days before the King\u2019s coronation. The King later credited Lister for his survival and quick recovery. Lister died in 1912.\n    (Summary by Martin Clifton)", "num_sections": 1, "sections": {"0": {"number": 0, "name": "On the Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery", "url": "https://ia802303.us.archive.org/20/items/antiseptic_principle_surgery_librivox/antisepticprinciple_lister_mac_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": [" joseph lister"], "genres": ["medical"], "totaltime": "00:31:32"}

Songs of Innocence contains poems either written from the perspective of children or written about them. Many of the poems appearing in Songs of Innocence have a counterpart in Songs of Experience, with quite a different perspective of the world.\n\n    The disastrous end of the French Revolution caused Blake to lose faith in the goodness of mankind, explaining much of the despair found in Songs of Experience. Blake also believed that children lost their innocence through exploitation and from a religious community which put dogma before mercy. He did not, however, believe that children should be kept from becoming experienced entirely. In truth, he believed that children should indeed become experienced but through their own discoveries, which is reflected in a number of these poems.\n\n    (Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Annie

Lewis than was later evidenced in his Christian apologist writings.\nThe darkness of the verse is most evident in Part One (The Prison House), begins to change in the short transitional Part Two (Hesitation) and attains a more hopeful tone in the final Part Three (Escape).  Yet a dreamy effect, influenced by Celtic and Druid mythology, persists throughout.\nSpirits in Bondage consists of forty poems that provide an intriguing insight into the youthful heart of C.S. Lewis and occasionally provides interesting lyrical foreshadowing of some of the landscapes portrayed in his famous Chronicles of Narnia series.\n(Summary by Robert Garrison)\n", "num_sections": 3, "sections": {"0": {"number": 0, "name": "Spirits in Bondage - Part 3", "url": "https://ia600209.us.archive.org/10/items/spirits_bondage_librivox/spirits_in_bondage_03_hamilton_c_64kb.mp3"}, "1": {"number": 1, "name": "Spirits in Bondage - Part 1", "url": "https://ia600209.us.archive.org/10/items/spirits_bondage_librivox/spirits_in_bondage_01_hamilton_c_64kb.mp3"}, "2": {"number": 2, "name": "Spirits in Bondage - Part 2", "url": "https://ia600209.us.archive.org/10/items/spirits_bondage_librivox/spirits_in_bondage_02_hamilton_c_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": ["c. s. lewis"], "genres": ["poetry"], "totaltime": "1:17:55"}

Hoffmann, a Frankfurt physician, wanted to buy a picture book for his son for Christmas in 1844.

While Struwwelpeter is somewhat notorious for its perceived brutal treatment of the erring children, it has been influential on many later children\u2019s books, most notably Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

{"id": 233, "title": "sunshine sketches of a little town", "description": "    Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town is a sequence of stories by Stephen Leacock, first published in 1912. It is generally considered to be one of the most enduring classics of Canadian humorous literature.\n\n    The fictional setting for these stories is Mariposa, a small town on the shore of Lake Wissanotti. Although drawn from his experiences in Orillia, Ontario, Leacock writes in the introduction:\n\n    \u201cMariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of them. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.\u201d\n\n    This work has remained popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modelled on townspeople of Orillia, are small town archetypes. Their shortcomings and weaknesses are presented in a humorous but affectionate way.\n\n    Often, the narrator greatly exaggerates the importance of the events in Mariposa compared to the rest of the world. For example, when there is a country-wide election, \u201cthe town of Mariposa, was, of course, the storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil.\u201d (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n", "num_sections": 13, "sections": {"4": {"number": 4, "name": "04 - The Ministrations of the Rev.

{"id": 238, "title": "philosophy and fun of algebra", "description": "Mary Everest Boole (1832-1916) was born Mary Everest in England and spent her early years in France. She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular.\nThis short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \u201calgebra\u201d broadly, defining it as a \u201cmethod of solving problems by honest confession of one\u2019s ignorance\u201d. Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra\u2019s essential element is \u201cthe habitual registration of the exact limits of one\u2019s knowledge\u201d and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.\n(Summary written by Patricia Oakley)", "num_sections": 18, "sections": {"15": {"number": 15, "name": "15 - Square Root of Minus One", "url": "https://ia600706.us.archive.org/22/items/philosophy_fun_algebra_librivox/philosophyandfunofalgebra_15_boole_64kb.mp3"}, "14": {"number": 14, "name": "14 - Go Out of My Class-Room", "url": "https://ia600706.us.archive.org/22/items/philosophy_fun_algebra_librivox/philosophyandfunofalgebra_14_boole_64kb.mp3"}, "3": {"number": 3, "name": "03 - Simultaneous Problems", "url": "https://ia600706.us.archive.org/22/items/philosophy_fun_algebra_librivox/philosophyandfunofalgebra_03_boole_64kb.mp3"}, "4": {"number": 4, "name": "04 - Partial Solutions..

{"id": 268, "title": "love conquers all", "description": "Robert Benchley, 1889-1945, was a writer, humorist and actor of note during the 1920s through the early 1940s. Born in Massachusetts, he spent his early literary career in New York City as an editor, critic and columnist for many of the major magazines of the day.\nAlong with George Kaufman, Dorothy Parker and Harpo Marx, he was an original \"member\" of the Algonquin Round Table. His popularity led him to a side career in radio and film, which took him to California in his later years. Writers as diverse as James Thurber, Woody Allen and Dave Barry have credited Benchley as an influence.\nLove Conquers All, originally published in 1922 is the second collection (of fifteen) gathering together Benchley's humorous essays and reviews. Some references are dated, of course, but the surreal and mundane targets of Benchley's wit will be familiar to everyone. This volume collects 63 excellent gems from his early professional work, when Benchley's enthusiasm and style were approaching their peak.\n(Summary by Ted Delorme)", "num_sections": 13, "sections": {"5": {"number": 5, "name": "Chapters 01-05", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_01-05_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "10": {"number": 10, "name": "Chapters 06-10", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_06-10_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "15": {"number": 15, "name": "Chapters 11-15", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_11-15_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "20": {"number": 20, "name": "Chapters 16-20", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_16-20_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "25": {"number": 25, "name": "Chapters 21-25", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_21-25_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "30": {"number": 30, "name": "Chapters 26-30", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_26-30_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "35": {"number": 35, "name": "Chapters 31-35", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_31-35_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "40": {"number": 40, "name": "Chapters 36-40", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_36-40_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "45": {"number": 45, "name": "Chapters 41-45", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_41-45_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "50": {"number": 50, "name": "Chapters 46-50", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_46-50_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "55": {"number": 55, "name": "Chapters 51-55", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_51-55_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "59": {"number": 59, "name": "Chapters 56-59", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_56-59_benchley_64kb.mp3"}, "63": {"number": 63, "name": "Chapters 60-63", "url": "https://ia600309.us.archive.org/6/items/love_conquers_all_librivox/loveconquersall_60-63_benchley_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": ["robert c. benchley"], "genres": ["humorous fiction"], "totaltime": "6:53:02"}

However, it also is enlivened by Baum\u2019s considerable wit, penchant for puns, and dry social commentary. In this title, Dorothy, her kitten Eureka, Jim, a cab horse, and Zeb, a ranch hand, descend into the earth through a rift opened by an earthquake. There they encounter the \u201chumbug\u201d wizard who once ruled Oz. In their journey back to the earth\u2019s surface, they meet a number of potentially dangerous magical peoples and creatures including the cold-blooded Mangaboos, invisible bears, the flying wooden Gargoyles, a den of dragonettes, and an eccentric inventor. With a little help from Ozma, the group end up in Oz where they are treated to feasts and celebrations. The animals end up humbled by a few of their experiences in Oz, where all animals can talk, and return home a little wiser.

{"id": 281, "title": "gerrard street mystery and other weird tales", "description": "John Charles Dent, the author of the following remarkable stories, was born in Kendal, Westmorland, England, in 1841. His parents emigrated to Canada shortly after that event, bringing with them, of course, the youth who was afterwards to become the Canadian author and historian. Mr. Dent received his primary education in Canadian schools, and afterwards studied law, becoming in due course a member of the Upper Canada Bar. He only practised for a few years, then returned to England to pursue a literary career, writing mostly for periodicals. After remaining in England for several years, Mr. Dent and his family moved to Boston, in America, for about two years. But he finally returned to Canada, accepting a journalistic position in Toronto. Mr. Dent proceeded to write 'The Canadian Portrait Gallery', which ran to four large volumes, 'The Last Forty Years: Canada since the Union of 1841', and a 'History of the Rebellion in Upper Canada'.This collected work of his short fiction, contributed by their author at considerable intervals to different periodicals, was published posthumously. The stories themselves are delightfully anchored in the physical geography of Upper Canada (or in the case of 'Gagtooth's Image', Illinois), and have a mystical and spooky air about them.

{"id": 301, "title": "sky island", "description": "Sky Island (1912) was the second of three titles written by Baum featuring a spunky girl from California, Trot, and her companion, the old sailorman, Cap\u2019n Bill. Baum had hoped to end the Oz series in 1910 and the following year he introduced Trot and Cap\u2019n Bill in The Sea Fairies. In Sky Island, they journey to an island in the sky by means of an enchanted umbrella belonging to Button Bright, a character who first appeared in The Road to Oz (1909). The trio is then captured by the Boolaroo of the Blues, a monarch who is both comical and dangerous, escape to the country of the \u201cPinks\u201d, and eventually regain the magic umbrella and return back to earth. This is one of Baum\u2019s best fantasy books and contains enough not-so-veiled commentary on race and politics to interest adults as well. However, it (and The Sea Fairies) did not sell as well as the Oz books and Baum resumed writing them in 1913. He subsequently brought Trot and Cap\u2019n Bill to Oz in 1915 in The Scarecrow of Oz.\n(Summary by Judy Bieber)", "num_sections": 30, "sections": {"1": {"number": 1, "name": "01_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_01_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "2": {"number": 2, "name": "02_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_02_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "3": {"number": 3, "name": "03_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_03_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "4": {"number": 4, "name": "04_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_04_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "5": {"number": 5, "name": "05_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_05_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "6": {"number": 6, "name": "06_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_06_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "7": {"number": 7, "name": "07_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_07_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "8": {"number": 8, "name": "08_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_08_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "9": {"number": 9, "name": "09_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_09_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "10": {"number": 10, "name": "10_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_10_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "11": {"number": 11, "name": "11_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_11_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "12": {"number": 12, "name": "12_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_12_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "13": {"number": 13, "name": "13_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_13_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "14": {"number": 14, "name": "14_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_14_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "15": {"number": 15, "name": "15_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_15_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "16": {"number": 16, "name": "16_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_16_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "17": {"number": 17, "name": "17_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_17_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "18": {"number": 18, "name": "18_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_18_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "19": {"number": 19, "name": "19_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_19_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "20": {"number": 20, "name": "20_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_20_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "21": {"number": 21, "name": "21_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_21_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "22": {"number": 22, "name": "22_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_22_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "23": {"number": 23, "name": "23_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_23_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "24": {"number": 24, "name": "24_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_24_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "25": {"number": 25, "name": "25_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_25_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "26": {"number": 26, "name": "26_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_26_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "27": {"number": 27, "name": "27_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_27_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "28": {"number": 28, "name": "28_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_28_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "29": {"number": 29, "name": "29_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_29_baum_64kb.mp3"}, "30": {"number": 30, "name": "30_baum_skyisland", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/4/items/sky_island_librivox/skyisland_30_baum_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": ["l. frank baum"], "genres": ["action & adventure"], "totaltime": "5:40:54"}

His witty, biting and occasionally odd short stories satirised Edwardian culture. Saki is considered a master of the short story and has been compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker as well as Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde (who clearly influenced Saki.) His first collection of short stories, Reginald, was published by Methuen Press in 1904 though these stories first appeared in the 'Westminster Gazette'. The stories in this collection are a foil for allowing the jaded and insider/outsider figure of Reginald to comment on some ridiculous or provincial attitude prevelant in upperclass Edwardian society, although one can easily recoginize these same attitudes in our society today. Long popular and well known, Saki's brilliant humour is as enjoyable now as it was almost a century ago.

It begins with an intriguing fortune offered to John Harmon by his late father, a rich dust contractor, in his will. To receive the money, John must marry a certain Bella Wilfer who he does not know from Eve. He is returning from the exile enforced by his father and confides in a ship's mate who attempts to murder him. The mate gets killed instead, leaving one inconvenient corpse. Because John is considered dead (the body is found with his papers), the money passes to Mr Boffin, old Harmon's foreman. Harmon adopts Bella and John comes into his employ disguised as John Rokesmith. Bella does not fall for John but through kindly Boffin's contrivances learns to hate money and fall for her suitor under his false name. Eventually she learns of his true identity as the Boffins had previously, and the villainous one-legged Silas Wegg's plot to blackmail Mr Boffin is brought to light. There is also a story running behind the main plot about a certain Eugene Wrayburn and his love for Lizzie Hexam, and his rival's attempt to murder him. The two plots are only really connected through the waterside murders but it allows Dickens to indulge in an extremely socially diverse cast of characters.

It first appeared, serialised in Punch magazine and might be regarded as the first \u2018blog\u2019; being a record of the simplicities and humiliations in the life of this mundane, but upright, city clerk, who had an incontestable faith that a record of his daily life was worth preserving for posterity.\nSet in about 1891 in Holloway, which was then a typical suburb of the impecuniously respectable kind, the authors contrive a record of the manners, customs and experiences of the late Victorian era. The bare record of facts, simply recorded, manages to be humorous rather than dull, no doubt because of the usual occupations of the authors.\nGeorge Grossmith (1847-1912) was an actor and comedian.\nWeedon Grossmith (1852-1919) was an entertainer and illustrated the original work.\n(Summary by Martin Clifton)", "num_sections": 25, "sections": {"0": {"number": 0, "name": "The Diary of a

In this book, Dorothy and her impoverished Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are on the brink of losing their Kansas farm. Consequently, Ozma invites them all to live in the Emerald City. They then explore the countryside, visiting a series of strange beings including the Cuttenclips, the Fuddles, the Rigmaroles, the Flutterbudgets, and the residents of Utensia, Bunbury and Bunnybury. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry also meet old friends like the Wizard, the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead and H. M. Wogglebug T. E. The travelers\u2019 idyll is brought short by the plot of an old enemy, the Nome King. Seeking revenge for the loss of his magic belt, the Nome King has an underground tunnel built so he can invade and plunder Oz and enslave its peoples. Our friends manage to defeat the Nome King and his allies, but sobered by this threat, Glinda and Ozma decide to cut off Oz from the outside world forever. Happily for Oz fans, forever lasted only three years. Baum invented a way to reopen communications with Oz and eight more Oz books were published between 1913-1920.

The genres also vary, and include romance, Breton lai, sermon, beast fable, and fabliau.

The story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic finds out, however, that he was born on 29 February, and so, technically, he only has a birthday each leap year. His apprenticeship indentures state that he remains apprenticed to the pirates until his 21st birthday, and so he must serve for another 63 years. Bound by his own sense of duty, Frederic's only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.

(To this day, \u201ctar baby\u201d as an expression for a particularly sticky situation that is almost impossible to solve, has passed into the English language and common use.) Even people who have never read any of these tales will know exactly why you don\u2019t throw a rabbit into a briar patch, mainly because Walt Disney produced his first movie ever to use professional actors with animation, called \u201cSong of the South\u201d, based on the Uncle Remus tales.\n\n    Joel Chandler Harris, a newsman in Georgia, grew up listening to folktales told by the local black population. Later, he published his version of these tales in a series of stories printed in the \u201cAtlanta Constitution.\u201d The tales of, and by, Harris\u2019 chief character Uncle Remus, an old black man scrabbling to make his living in the post-Civil War South, were extremely popular and widely read. Harris\u2019 use of innovative spelling to give the reader a sense of the black dialect was considered novel.\n\n    While this is not a book that will pass a current political correctness test, due to its use of labels for black folks which have gone out of polite conversation, Uncle Remus is a largely sympathetic look at post-war plantation life. Uncle Remus himself is a warm, folksy man of good humor and dry wit, and after finishing his animal stories, the remaining sayings and tales are a moment of history frozen in amber.

{"id": 367, "title": "prince and the pauper", "description": "The Prince and the Pauper (1882) represents Mark Twain's first attempt at historical fiction. The book, set in 1547, tells the story of two young boys who are identical in appearance: Tom Canty, a pauper who lives with his abusive father in Offal Court, London, and Prince Edward son of Henry VIII of England.  Due to a series of circumstances, the boys accidentally replace each other, and much of the humor in the book originates in the two boys' inability to function in the world that is so familiar to the other (although Tom soon displays considerable wisdom in his decisions). In many ways, the book is a social satire, particularly compelling in its condemnation of the inequality that existed between the classes in Tudor England. In that sense, Twain abandoned the wry Midwestern style for which he was best known and adopts a style reminiscent of Charles Dickens.

{"id": 376, "title": "fanny hill: memoirs of a woman of pleasure", "description": "Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (1749) was the first widely-read English novel in the genre \u201cErotica.\u201d It was written by John Cleland as he was serving hard time at a debtor\u2019s prison in London. Over the centuries, the novel has been repeatedly banned by authorities, assuring its preeminent role in the history of the ongoing struggle against censorship of free expression.\nUntil Fanny Hill, previous heroines had conducted their amorous liaisons \u201coff-stage.\u201d Any erotic misadventures were described euphemistically. As women who had gone astray, they always repented, which made even their most outrageous dalliances somehow suitable for a moralistic readership. The protagonist of Fanny Hill, however, never repented a single moment of her sexual exploits \u2026 quite the contrary! And with Fanny, the devil is in the details, realistically described.

{"id": 382, "title": "gods of mars", "description": "\nThe Gods of Mars is a 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs science fiction novel, the second of his famous Barsoom series.It can be said that the novel set the tone for much science fiction to come. Its influence can clearly be seen in franchises such as Star Trek and Farscape. While Burroughs no doubt borrowed liberally from the pulp fiction of his day, particularly westerns and swashbuckling tales, the pacing and themes set the tone for the soft science fiction genre.The protagonist, John Carter, with his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and flirtations with beautiful alien women, could be said to have set the mold for later influential icons like Captain James T. Kirk and James Bond.At the end of the first book, A Princess of Mars, John Carter is unwillingly transported back to Earth. The Gods of Mars begins with his arrival back on Barsoom (Mars) after a ten year hiatus, separated from his wife Dejah Thoris, his unborn child, and the Red Martian people of the nation of Helium, whom he has adopted as his own. Unfortunately, John Carter materializes in the one place on Barsoom from which nobody is allowed to depart: the Valley Dor, which is the Barsoomian heaven.

{"id": 388, "title": "four million", "description": "Born in 1862 and died in 1910, O. Henry\u2019s birth name is William Sydney Porter; however, he adopted the pen name O. Henry while in prison. He published 10 collections and over 600 short stories during his lifetime.The Four Million is the second book written by O. Henry while he served time for embezzlement in a penitentiary in Ohio. The book is a series of short stories which take place in New York City in the early years of the 20th century and are representative of the surprise endings that popularized O. Henry\u2019s work.

{"id": 418, "title": "swiss family robinson", "description": "    The Swiss Family Robinson has delighted generations of readers with its exciting tale of a family which, though shipwrecked, displays \u201cthe right stuff\u201d and builds a charming colony that later, they do not want to leave. Cut off from the comforts and companionship of other humans, they use a familiarity with natural history and biology to find the resources and build the tools to construct a canoe, weave cloth, irrigate a garden, and turn an immense hollow tree into a lofty house with a spiral staircase. They domesticate buffaloes, wild asses, and monkeys. They establish farms and plantations. And finally, they have a terrifying encounter with natives from a nearby island.Johann David Wyss, the author, did not live to complete his tale. Storytellers over the years have injected so many episodes into the various versions that probably none closely match the original. (Indeed, the Baroness de Montholieu expanded the book from two volumes into five when she translated it into French.) This effort was re-translated into English in 1849 by W.H.G. Kingston, abridging the edition severely. It follows the British sensibilities of the period in terms of sentence structure and emphasis. (Summary by Mark F.

This is a tough, literary journey. It was tough for Twain and his fellow \u201cpilgrims\u201d, both religious and otherwise. They set out, on a June day in 1867, to visit major tourist sites in Europe and the near east, including Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, \u201cthe Holy Land\u201d, and Egypt. What Twain records, in often humorous, sometimes grotesque but always fascinating detail, are the day-to-day ups and downs of discovering the truth about people and places. The truths they learn are often far different than their education and rumor have made them preconceive.\n\nThis is a voyage of discovery. It\u2019s long and, in places, tiresome. But it\u2019s revelatory about so much. As with some of his other works, Twain includes popular prejudices of his time, which are today considered socially unacceptable. His references to \u201cIndians\u201d, \u201cNegroes\u201d and \u201cinfidels\u201d come to mind.\n\nBeyond the lows, though, there are the highs of Twain\u2019s cutting wit and insight as he guides us along the bumpy and often dangerous voyage.\nNo need to buckle up.

{"id": 426, "title": "invisible man", "description": "The Invisible Man (1897) is one of the most famous science fiction novels of all time. Written by H.G. Wells (1866-1946), it tells the story of a scientist who discovers the secret of invisibility and uses it on himself. The story begins as the Invisible Man, with a bandaged face and a heavy coat and gloves, takes a train to lodge in a country inn whilst he tries to discover the antidote and make himself visible again.

{"id": 427, "title": "king in yellow (part 1)", "description": "Robert W. Chambers (1865-1933) studied art in Paris in the late 80's and early 90's, where his work was displayed at the Salon. However, shortly after returning to America, he decided to spend his time in writing. He became popular as the writer of a number of romantic novels, but is now best known as the author of \"The King In Yellow\". This is a collection of the first half of this work of short stories which have an eerie, other-worldly feel to it; but the stories in the second half are essentially love stories, strongly coloured by the author's life as an artist in France.\nOnly the first half of the collection of stories is presented here: the earlier stories are all coloured by the background presence of a play, \"The King In Yellow\" itself, which corrupts those who read it, and opens them to horrible experiences and to visions of a ghastly other world, lit by dark stars and distorted skies. This half of the collection is completed by a few very short pieces and two rather strange and beautiful stories of love and time, loneliness and death.

It was thought to have been sold to the publisher for \u00a360 on Oliver Goldsmith's behalf by Dr Johnson to enable Goldsmith to pay off outstanding rent and to release himself from his landlady's arrest.\nIt is the story of the family of Dr Primrose, a benevolent vicar, and follows them through their fall from fortune and their ultimate rise again. The story provides insight into family life and circumstances in the mid 18th century and the plot has many aspects of a pantomime like quality: Impersonation, deception, an aristocratic villain and the abduction of a beautiful heroine.\nGoldsmith himself dissipated his savings on gambling whilst a student at Trinity College Dublin and subsequently travelled in Europe sustaining himself by playing the flute and disputing doctrinal matters in monasteries and universities. Later he worked as an apothecary's assistant, a doctor and a school usher (experiences shared in this story by Dr Primrose's son).\n(Summary by Martin Clifton)", "num_sections": 32, "sections": {"1":

{"id": 436, "title": "war of the worlds", "description": "H. G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels.  In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.\nThe frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martian rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture.  The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, The War of the Worlds has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.\nThe novel demonstrates Wells' typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people's ignorance and vanity. The War of the Worlds can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time - with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared.  Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.(Summary by Stephan M\u00f6bius and Annie Coleman)\nIllustrations by Stephan M\u00f6bius\nBook 1 - Chapter 1: Map of Surrey\nBook 1 - Chapter 5: The Cylinder Opens - 1, The Cylinder Opens - 2\nBook 1 - Chapter 11: In the Storm\nBook 1 - Chapter 12: At the Window\nBook 1 - Chapter 16: What Had Happened in Surrey\nBook 1 - Chapter 17: The Exodus from London\nBook 2 - Chapter 2: Under Foot\n\n\n", "num_sections": 27, "sections": {"3": {"number": 3, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 2 - Chapter 03", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_20_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "11": {"number": 11, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 11", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_11_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "16": {"number": 16, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 16", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_16_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "7": {"number": 7, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 2 - Chapter 07", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_24_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "9": {"number": 9, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 09", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_09_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "15": {"number": 15, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 15", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_15_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "17": {"number": 17, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 17", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_17_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "14": {"number": 14, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 14", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_14_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "8": {"number": 8, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 08", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_08_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "13": {"number": 13, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 13", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_13_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "12": {"number": 12, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 12", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_12_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "2": {"number": 2, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 02", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_02_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "10": {"number": 10, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 2 - Chapter 10", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_27_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "5": {"number": 5, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 2 - Chapter 05", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_22_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "4": {"number": 4, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 1 - Chapter 04", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_04_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "6": {"number": 6, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 2 - Chapter 06", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_23_wells_64kb.mp3"}, "1": {"number": 1, "name": "The War of the Worlds - Book 2 - Chapter 01", "url": "https://ia600707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_of_the_worlds_18_wells_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": ["h. g. wells"], "genres": ["science fiction"], "totaltime": "6:43:20"}
{"id": 437, "title": "warden", "description": "    Amongst the great popular novelists of the nineteenth century who are still read today, Anthony Trollope stands alongside his contemporary, Charles Dickens. His two series of novels, the political (The Pallisers) and the clerical (The Barsetshire Chronicles) are the best known. This book is the first of the Barsetshire series and was also Trollope\u2019s first really successful novel.\n\n    In the mid nineteenth century there were a number of financial scandals in the Church of England including those of Rochester, where the endowments which should have supported the King\u2019s School Canterbury had been diverted to the Dean and Chapter; and of the hospital of St Cross at Winchester where the Rev. Francis North, later the Earl of Guildford, had been appointed to the mastership of the hospital by his father the bishop. The revenues of the hospital were very considerable, the work involved minimal. The scandal soon broke.\n\n    Trollope based \u2018The Warden\u2019 on the St Cross case, but in the novel the Warden is a kindly, devoted, priest, beloved by all that knew him and is racked by fear that he is accepting money to which he is not entitled. His antagonist is his prospective son-in-law John Bold and his (somewhat unwelcome) ally is one of Trollope\u2019s strongest characters, the Archdeacon of Barchester, Dr. Theophilus Grantly.

{"id": 439, "title": "wind in the willows (version 2)", "description": "This much-loved story follows a group of animal friends in the English countryside as they pursue adventure ... and as adventure pursues them!  The chief characters - Mole, Rat, and Toad - generally lead upbeat and happy lives, but their tales are leavened with moments of terror, homesickness, awe, madcap antics, and derring-do.\nAlthough classed as children's literature, The Wind in the Willows holds a gentle fascination for adults too.  The vocabulary is decidedly not \"Dick and Jane\", and a reader with a love of words will find new ones to treasure, even if well-equipped for the journey.  Parents will appreciate the themes of loyalty, manners, self-restraint, and comradeship which are evident throughout the book.  When the characters err, they are prompt to acknowlege it, and so a reading of this book can model good behavior to children, who will otherwise be enchanted with the many ways in which the lives of these bucolic characters differ from modern life.\nThis book was so successful that it enabled the author to retire from banking and take up a country life somewhat like that of his creations.

Father Brown is a short, nondescript Catholic Priest with shapeless clothes and a large umbrella who has an uncanny insight into human evil. His methods, unlike those of his near contemporary Sherlock Holmes, although based on observation of details often unnoticed by others, tended to be intuitive rather than deductive. Although clearly devout, he always emphasizes rationality: despite his religiousness and his belief in God and miracles, he manages to see the perfectly ordinary, natural explanation of the problem. He is a devout, educated and \"civilized\" clergyman, who is totally familiar with contemporary and secular thought and behavior.

{"id": 453, "title": "united states historical documents", "description": "The Articles of Confederation: On November 15th, 1777 The Articles of Confederation became the first constitution of the United States, though not yet ratified by the thirteen original colonies. Ratification of the Articles took place almost three and a half years later on March 1st, 1781. The purpose of the articles was to create a confederation of sovereign states with a weak central government; thus allowing state governments to wield most of the power. It wasn\u2019t long before the need for a stronger federal government was realized which led to the Articles being replaced by the United States Constitution. The Articles of Confederation is the common term for The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. \nThe U.S. Constitution: The United States Constitution is the legal backbone of the United States of America and comprises the basic laws of the United States Federal Government. Delegates from twelve of the thirteen original colonies put the Constitution\u2019s frame work together in May 1787 in Philadelphia. The Constitution defines the three branches of government and their jurisdictions; they are the Executive Branch (President/Vice President), Legislative Branch (Congress comprised of the Senate & House of Representatives), and the Judicial Branch (the Supreme Court). The need for three branches of government was to create a separation of powers so that not one person or group has full responsibilities, but that they\u2019re spread out and each branch must refer to the other by a means of checks and balances.\nThe Declaration of Independence: The Declaration of Independence is a document that is the epitome of freedom and liberty. It was drafted by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 as a list of grievances against the King of England, George III. The Declaration expresses the conviction of Americans in a philosophy of self-evident truths of what individual liberty and freedom should be. The Declaration was the beginning to separation from England and the catalyst for a birth of a nation.\nThe Gettysburg Address: The Gettysburg Address is considered one of the greatest and most quoted speeches of a President throughout American history. President Abraham Lincoln gave his address on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19th, 1863. It was a few months after the battle at Gettysburg was over, the purpose of Lincoln being there was to consecrate a cemetery to the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. It is believed that Lincoln\u2019s main goal of this opportunity was to fight for the United States as a united country and to express the equality of all under the law.

{"id": 456, "title": "dream days", "description": "Dream Days is a collection of children's fiction and reminiscences of childhood written by Kenneth Grahame. A sequel to Grahame's 1895 collection The Golden Age (some of its selections feature the same family of five children), Dream Days was first published in 1898 under the imprint John Lane: The Bodley Head. (The first six selections in the book had been previously published in periodicals of the day\u2014in the Yellow Book, the New Review, and in Scribner's Magazine in the United States.) The book is best known for its inclusion of Grahame's classic story The Reluctant Dragon. Like its precursor volume, Dream Days received strong approval from the literary critics of the day. In the decades since, the book has perhaps suffered a reputation as a thinner and weaker sequel to The Golden Age\u2014except for its single hit story. In one modern estimation, both books \"paint a convincingly unsentimental picture of childhood, with the adults in these sketches totally out of touch with the real concerns of the young people around them, including their griefs and rages.\"  Its concern is chiefly with the lands of imagination, ranging from a reconnaisance of men of solitude, a disastrous introduction of a girl to the narrator's private castle in the clouds, derring-do on the high seas, and, of course, an encounter with a dragon.  Its concluding bittersweet story bids a reluctant farewell to the dream days of childhood.

Listener be warned!  \nHere is some more information about the genesis of the LibriVox Ulysses project.  (Summary by Hugh McGuire)\n\nStill one of the most radical novels of the 20th Century, James Joyce's Ulysses is considered to have ushered in the era of the modern novel.  Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the book follows Leopold Bloom and a number of other characters through an ordinary day, twenty four hours, in Dublin, on June 16, 1904. The text is dense and difficult, but perfectly suited to an oral reading, filled with language tricks, puns and jokes, stream of consciousness, and bawdiness.\nFull cast list for sections 15f and 15g:\nCharacter identifications read by Chip\nRead by: Kirsten Ferreri and Max Porter Zasada\nBloom read by David Barnes\nStephen read by Alex Foster\nKitty read by Kristin LeMoine\nFlorry read by Alessia\nZoe read by Catharine Eastman\nLynch read by Stephan M\u00f6bius\nBella, list of names, and sundry characters read by Kymm Zuckert\nMarion read by Nikolle Doolin\nBoylan read by Rainer\nPrivate Carr read by Matthew Shepherd\nPrivate Compton read by Seth Woodworth\nCissy Caffrey read by Kara Shallenberg\nMaginni read by Hugh Mcguire\nThe Mother read by Cynthia Lyons\n\nAdditional sundry characters and background voices:\nPeter Yearsley, Martin Clifton, Stephan M\u00f6bius, Kymm Zuckert, Ted Delorme, Hajduk, John Greenman, Tina Tilney, Annie Coleman, The Good Reverend Doctor, Mark F.

Ezra Pound admired the \"delicate temperament\" of these early poems, while Yeats described \"I hear an army charging upon the land\" as \"a technical and emotional masterpiece\".

{"id": 470, "title": "time and the gods", "description": "Lord Dunsany (24 July 1878 \u2013 25 October 1957) was a London-born Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist notable for his work in fantasy. He was influenced by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote the line \"Time and the Gods are at strife\" in his 1866 poem \"Hymn to Proserpine\", as well as by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. In turn, Dunsany's influence was felt by H. P. Lovecraft and Ursula K. Le Guin. Arthur C. Clarke corresponded with Dunsany between 1944 and 1956. Those letters are collected in the book Arthur C. Clarke & Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence. Time and the Gods, a series of short stories written in a myth-like style, was first published in 1906.

{"id": 480, "title": "don quixote - vol. 1", "description": "Don Quixote is an early novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story in the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom he claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic manuscript he found in Toledo's bedraggled old Jewish quarter.\n\nThe protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so many stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes convinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho Panza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of adventures. His \"lady\" is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of his courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the illusion-struck \"knight\" (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never actually appears in the novel).\n\nPublished in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.

{"id": 482, "title": "my mark twain", "description": "William Dean Howells (1837-1920) became fast friends with Mark Twain from the moment in 1869 when Twain strode into the office of The Atlantic Monthly in Boston to thank Howell, then its assistant editor, for his favorable review of Innocents Abroad. When Howells became editor a few years later, The Atlantic Monthly began serializing many of Twain's works, among them his non-fiction masterpiece, Life on the Mississippi. In My Mark Twain, Howells pens a literary memoir that includes such fascinating scenes as their meetings with former president Ulysses Grant who was then writing the classic autobiography that Twain would underwrite in the largest publishing deal until that time. But it is also notable for its affectionate descriptions of his friend's family life during Howell's many visits to the Twain residences in Hartford and Stormfield. (Summary by Dennis Sayers).

This story transports the listener from the fine air and freedom of the mountaintop to the confines of Frankfurt, back to the peaks again, bounding in flowered fields with goats at your heels and sky utterly surrounding you.\n\nWe meet Heidi when she is 5, led up the mountain by her aunt who has raised the orphan but must leave now for a position in Frankfurt. In a mountain cottage overlooking the valley is Heidi\u2019s grandfather, and there with him the girl\u2019s sweet, free nature expands with the vista. The author\u2019s voice is straightforward, and so is our reader\u2019s, with the child\u2019s wonder, devotion, and sometimes humorous good intentions. When Heidi is taken from the mountains and nearly doesn\u2019t make it back again, the most humorous as well as most heart-wringing scenes occur. All she learns during her absence from the mountain she brings back as seeds that will grow to benefit everyone around her.

Mencken, the famous journalist, turned Nietzsche's German into such direct, plain-spoken American English that it puts the haranguing philosopher right up in your face.", "num_sections": 8, "sections": {"0": {"number": 0, "name": "1 - Introduction", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_01_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "1": {"number": 1, "name": "2 - Author's Preface", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_02_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "19": {"number": 19, "name": "Sections 1-19", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_03_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "26": {"number": 26, "name": "Sections 20-26", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_04_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "42": {"number": 42, "name": "Sections 27-42", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_05_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "47": {"number": 47, "name": "Sections 43-47", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_06_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "53": {"number": 53, "name": "Sections 48-53", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_07_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}, "62": {"number": 62, "name": "Sections 54-62", "url": "https://ia902305.us.archive.org/32/items/antichrist_librivox_/antichrist_08_nietzsche_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": ["friedrich nietzsche"], "genres": ["*non-fiction", "atheism & agnosticism"], "totaltime": "3:57:57"}
{"id": 501, "title": "bible (kjv) nt 03: luke", "description": "The Gospel of Luke is the most literary of the four gospels which recount the life and work of Jesus Christ. Although anonymous, the book is generally attributed to Luke, a physician and a missionary companion of the Apostle Paul. His account contains events which are unique in the four gospels including the visits of Gabriel to Mary and Zacharias, the visit of the shepherds to the birth of Jesus, and the story of the young Jesus at the temple. This gospel contains the most references to women and is favorable to the Gentiles for whom it was written. Perhaps the most well-known of all New Testament passages is the second chapter of Luke which tells of the birth of Christ.

{"id": 502, "title": "reviews", "description": "Wilde\u2019s literary reputation has survived so much that I think it proof against any exhumation of articles which he or his admirers would have preferred to forget.  As a matter of fact, I believe this volume will prove of unusual interest; some of the reviews are curiously prophetic; some are, of course, biassed by prejudice hostile or friendly; others are conceived in the author\u2019s wittiest and happiest vein; only a few are colourless.  And if, according to Lord Beaconsfield, the verdict of a continental nation may be regarded as that of posterity, Wilde is a much greater force in our literature than even friendly contemporaries ever supposed he would become.\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that at the time when most of these reviews were written Wilde had published scarcely any of the works by which his name has become famous in Europe, though the protagonist of the \u00e6sthetic movement was a well-known figure in Paris and London.

{"id": 509, "title": "thus spake zarathustra: a book for all and none", "description": "Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) was a nineteenth-century German philosopher. He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche's influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism. Thus Spake Zarathustra (Also sprach Zarathustra), is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the \"eternal recurrence of the same\", the parable on the \"death of God\", and the \"prophecy\" of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as \"the deepest ever written\", the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.

{"id": 511, "title": "collected public domain poems of wallace stevens, volume 1", "description": "A collection of Wallace Stevens poems written before 1923.Stevens trained to be a lawyer. Within eleven years after this series of poems were written, he was vice-president at the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company in Connecticut. He continued to pursue a quiet life of poetry and correspondence and for the remainder of his life he nurtured his contemplative habit of observation and writing as he walked from home to work and back again. Few at Hartford knew of his world acclaim as a poet. While his major work is considered to have been written when he was much older, many of these early poems are firm classics in the American poetic canon, including: \u201cAnecdote of the Jar,\u201d \u201cThe Emperor of Ice Cream,\u201d \u201cPeter Quince at the Clavier,\u201d \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d \u201cThe Snow Man,\u201d \u201cThirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,\u201d and many others. Stevens died of cancer in 1955, shortly after receiving that year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize for poetry.These poems originally appeared in a variety of magazines (Others, Secession, Rogue, The Soil, The Modern School, Broom, Contact, The New Republic, The Measure, The Little Review, The Dial, and particularly in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse.) Nearly 70 of the 101 published poems were later collected in Stevens' first published collection of poems, HARMONIUM.

{"id": 520, "title": "bible (asv) 18: job", "description": "The Book of Job (American Standard Version) is presented in forty-two chapters and is one of the Old Testament Wisdom Books. The narrative chronicles the trials of Job as he is brought low from a comfortable and exalted position in his community to face loss of his fortune, children and health. Joined by three friends who initially commiserate and sympathize with him, there ensues a lengthy argument about the fate of the wicked and the just and much questioning about the character of God and the justice He metes out to his creations.\nA quite lively and poetic discussion ensues among these wise elders and their suppositions and conclusions are eventually contested by a youth who enters the discussion toward the end. God has the final word in this narrative and Job is left to abjectly acknowledge that his complaints and knowledge mean little in the face of that which is so far beyond his ability to comprehend.\nDebate regarding the meaning, purpose and author of this book is still hotly contested among biblical scholars. It is far beyond the scope of this summary to offer any conclusions regarding this work. The reader offers the words to the listener with no judgment or further explanation.\nEven without deep examination, the poetic nature of the story offers many insights into facing and overcoming adversity.(Summary by Robert Garrison)", "num_sections": 6, "sections": {"28": {"number": 28, "name": "The Book of Job - Part 4 (Chapters 22-28)", "url": "https://ia802306.us.archive.org/19/items/book_of_job_librivox/job_asvbible_04_64kb.mp3"}, "0": {"number": 0, "name": "The Book of Job - Part 1 (Chapters 1-7)", "url": "https://ia802306.us.archive.org/19/items/book_of_job_librivox/job_asvbible_01_64kb.mp3"}, "35": {"number": 35, "name": "The Book of Job - Part 5 (Chapters 29-35)", "url": "https://ia802306.us.archive.org/19/items/book_of_job_librivox/job_asvbible_05_64kb.mp3"}, "21": {"number": 21, "name": "The Book of Job - Part 3 (Chapters 15-21)", "url": "https://ia802306.us.archive.org/19/items/book_of_job_librivox/job_asvbible_03_64kb.mp3"}, "42": {"number": 42, "name": "The Book of Job - Part 6 (Chapters 36-42)", "url": "https://ia802306.us.archive.org/19/items/book_of_job_librivox/job_asvbible_06_64kb.mp3"}, "14": {"number": 14, "name": "The Book of Job - Part 2 (Chapters 8-14)", "url": "https://ia802306.us.archive.org/19/items/book_of_job_librivox/job_asvbible_02_64kb.mp3"}}, "authors": ["american standard version"], "genres": ["*non-fiction", "religion"], "totaltime": "2:27:29"}

Who is the most important person? When is the most important time? What is worth owning? What is the most profound religion? What rules should men live by? How much land does a man need? Who is God?

{"id": 550, "title": "war is kind (collection)", "description": "Published in 1899, just a year before his death, War Is Kind by Stephen Crane evokes again the dark imagery of war which made his fortune in The Red Badge Of Courage. Unlike that book, this collection leaves the battlefield itself behind to explore the damage war does to people\u2019s hearts and minds. Reeking of dashed hopes, simultaneously sympathetic with the victims of war and cynical about the purposes of war, Crane implicitly criticizes the image of the romantic hero and asks if Love can survive.\nThe poetic voice is one of an old and wearied soul, stark and disillusioned, which is all the more intriguing since Crane was dead before he reached his 30th birthday. His work calls to mind the Beat Poets of the mid 20th century in its powerful use of language and bleak idiomatic landscape. It is poetry on the cusp of the fin de si\u00e8cle; echoing the passing age and presaging the newborn century.

{"id": 549, "title": "walden", "description": "Walden by Henry David Thoreau is one of the best-known non-fiction books written by an American. Published in 1854, it details Thoreau\u2019s life for two years, two months, and two days around the shores of Walden Pond.  Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised. Along with his critique of the civilized world, Thoreau examines other issues afflicting man in society, ranging from economy and reading to solitude and higher laws. He also takes time to talk about the experience at Walden Pond itself, commenting on the animals and the way people treated him for living there, using those experiences to bring out his philosophical positions. This extended commentary on nature has often been interpreted as a strong statement to the natural religion that transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson were preaching.

Wells) was published in 1898 at a time when he wrote a series of novels related to a number of historical events of the time.

{"id": 561, "title": "life and adventures of santa claus", "description": "This story of Santa Claus veers away slightly from the traditional stories of his beginnings. L. Frank Baum creates a world of fantasy that surrounds Santa Claus's life. Orphaned at an infant he is found by the nymph Necile, who convinces the great Ak to allow her to raise Claus for her own. As he grows older he meets his fellow humans, and sees the neglect of children. This sets him on the path to making toys and becoming the beloved Saint Nicholas we are familiar with today.

{"id": 563, "title": "vanity fair", "description": "Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero is a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray that satirizes society in early 19th-century England. Like many novels of the time, Vanity Fair was published as a serial before being sold in book form; it was printed in 20 monthly parts between January 1847 and July 1848.Thackeray meant the book to be not only entertaining but also instructive; this is shown both by the narrator of the book and in Thackeray's private correspondence. The novel is now remembered as a classic of English literature, though some critics claim that it has structural problems; Thackeray sometimes lost track of the huge scope of his work, mixing up characters' names and minor plot details. The number of allusions and references it contains can make it difficult for modern readers to follow.", "num_sections": 67, "sections": {"40": {"number": 40, "name": "40 - In Which Becky Is Recognized by the Family", "url": "https://ia802705.us.archive.org/24/items/vanity_fair_librivox/vanity_fair_40_thackeray_64kb.mp3"}, "65": {"number": 65, "name": "65 -

{"id": 568, "title": "lady susan (version 2)", "description": "Jane Austen demonstrated her mastery of the epistolary novel genre in Lady Susan, which she wrote in 1795 but never published. Although the primary focus of this short novel is the selfish behavior of Lady Susan as she engages in affairs and searches for suitable husbands for herself and her young daughter, the actual action shares its importance with Austen\u2019s manipulation of her characters' behavior by means of their reactions to the letters that they receive. The heroine adds additional interest by altering the tone of her own letters based on the recipient of the letter. Thus, the character of Lady Susan is developed through many branches as Austen suggests complications of identity and the way in which that identity is based on interaction rather than on solitary constructions of personality.

Whether it has ever been written in Japanese I do not know; but the extraordinary belief which it records used certainly to exist in most parts of Japan, and in many curious forms\u2026 The incident of \"Riki-Baka\" was a personal experience; and I wrote it down almost exactly as it happened, changing only a family-name mentioned by the Japanese narrator.

Wells, addressing ideas of society and community, human nature and identity, religion, Darwinism, and eugenics.When the novel was written in the late 19th century, England's scientific community was engulfed by debates on animal vivisection. Interest groups were even formed to tackle the issue: the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection was formed two years after the publication of the novel. The novel is presented as a discovered manuscript, introduced by the narrator's nephew; it then 'transcribes' the tale.

{"id": 600, "title": "awakening", "description": "Owing to its highly personal content focused on feminine sexuality, this LibriVox edition was recorded by eight female readers. \n\nThe Modern Library edition of The Awakening has an introduction by Kay Gibbons, who writes: \u201cThe Awakening shocked turn-of-the-century readers with its forthright treatment of sex and suicide. Departing from literary convention, Kate Chopin failed to condemn her heroine\u2019s desire for an affair with the son of a Louisiana resort owner, whom she meets on vacation. The power of sensuality, the delusion of ecstatic love, and the solitude that accompanies the trappings of middle- and upper-class life are the themes of this now-classic novel.\u201d \u2013 As Kay Gibbons points out, Chopin \u201cwas writing American realism before most Americans could bear to hear that they were living it.\u201d\n\nTo give you an idea of the subject matter, Project Gutenburg catalogues The Awakening under \"Adultery -- Fiction -- Women -- Louisiana -- New Orleans -- Social conditions.

{"id": 602, "title": "critique of pure reason", "description": "The Critique of Pure Reason, first published in 1781 with a second edition in 1787, has been called the most influential and important philosophical text of the modern age.Kant saw the Critique of Pure Reason as an attempt to bridge the gap between rationalism (there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience) and empiricism (sense experience is the ultimate source of all our concepts and knowledge) and, in particular, to counter the radical empiricism of David Hume (our beliefs are purely the result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences). Using the methods of science, Kant demonstrates that though each mind may, indeed, create its own universe, those universes are guided by certain common laws, which are rationally discernable.

{"id": 607, "title": "captain blood", "description": "Captain Blood is an adventure novel by Rafael Sabatini, originally published in 1922. It concerns the sharp-witted Dr. Peter Blood, an Irish physician, who is convicted of treason in the aftermath of the Monmouth rebellion in 1685, and enslaved on the Caribbean island of Barbados. He escapes and becomes a pirate. [wikipedia]\n\nCaptain Blood was the basis for the Academy Award-nominated swashbuckling film that rocketed Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland to stardom in Hollywood. The fast-paced historical fiction of Rafael Sabatini is often compared with that of Robert Louis Stevenson and Alexandre Dumas.

{"id": 609, "title": "selected early poems of william carlos williams", "description": "Williams was born in Rutherford, New Jersey, a community near the city of Paterson. His father was an English immigrant, and his mother was born in Puerto Rico. He attended public school in Rutherford until 1897, then was sent to study at Ch\u00e2teau de Lancy near Geneva, Switzerland, the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet in Paris, France, for two years and Horace Mann School in New York City. Then, in 1902, he entered the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. During his time at Penn, Williams befriended Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle (best known as H.D.) and the painter Charles Demuth. These friendships supported his growing passion for poetry. He received his M.D. in 1906 and spent the next four years in internships in New York City and in travel and postgraduate studies abroad (e.g., at the University of Leipzig where he studied pediatrics). He returned to Rutherford in 1910 and began his medical practice, which lasted until 1951. Ironically, most of his patients knew little if anything of his writings; instead they viewed him as a doctor who helped deliver over 2,000 of their children into the world.

When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferrars, a match that seems much more suitable. All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways. Since this is an Austen novel and a romance, be assured that all comes right in the end.

{"id": 628, "title": "little women", "description": "Little Women is the classic story of The March family, which consists of Mr. and Mrs. March and their four girls--Practical, yet fashion conscious Meg, who longs for the nice things they used to have. Rambunctious, book worm, Jo, who wants to become a writer and wishes she were born a boy. Shy and quiet, home-loving Beth, who loves to play the piano and play with her kitties. Finally, the youngest, artistic Amy, who longs for an aristocratic nose!\n\nThe story takes place during the American Civil War, and begins with Mr. March away from home as a chaplain to the Union army, while his wife and daughters remain at home to work and wait for his safe return.  This book follows their joys and sorrows and scrapes along the path to the girl's becoming grown up \"little women\". \n\nMany of the scrapes they get into include Laurie--their harum scarum next door neighbor, who becomes their adopted brother. The two families, The March's and the Laurence's strike up a lasting friendship, despite their differences in material belongings.

{"id": 637, "title": "personal collection of short tales compiled by carmie", "description": "This is a selection of the fairy tales (in English) written by Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Karl Grimm in the early 19th Century. These stories are fantastical and although aimed squarely at the flexible mind of a child which can assimilate much stranger concepts than an adult they are quite dark and occasionally brutal. The stakes can be quite high as in Rumpelstiltskin where a terrible bargain is made without due regard to possible future consequences and Tom Thumb who seems forever about to be imprisoned or sliced in two.\n\nThese are moral tales and this selection features some of the less 'grim' of those tales but they are still a 1000 times more exciting and vivid than many more modern fairy tales.\n\nThe Gutenberg edition from which most of these stories were read contains some delightful pictures to accompany the stories. The pictures can be viewed here. The exception to this is the story, Puss in Boots which is from an Andrew Lang collection which can be found here.

{"id": 639, "title": "lady susan", "description": "Jane Austen demonstrated her mastery of the epistolary novel genre in Lady Susan, which she wrote in 1795 but never published. Although the primary focus of this short novel is the selfish behavior of Lady Susan as she engages in affairs and searches for suitable husbands for herself and her young daughter, the actual action shares its importance with Austen\u2019s manipulation of her characters' behavior by means of their reactions to the letters that they receive. The heroine adds additional interest by altering the tone of her own letters based on the recipient of the letter. Thus, the character of Lady Susan is developed through many branches as Austen suggests complications of identity and the way in which that identity is based on interaction rather than on solitary constructions of personality. Lady Susan\u2019s character is also built by the descriptions of the other letter-writers; but even though their opinions of this heroine coincide with the image that develops from her own letters, Austen demonstrates the subjectivity of the opinions by presenting them \u2013 primarily \u2013 in the letters of one woman to another, thereby suggesting the established literary motifs of feminine gossip and jealousy. Readers recognize these subjective motifs and examine all of the idiosyncrasies of the characters in order to create their own opinion of Lady Susan \u2013 as they would of any real acquaintance.

Law revolutionized the way in which 18th century Anglicans engaged the spiritual aspect of their faith, and his popularity rivaled that of John and Charles Wesley. Law adapted mystical practices from early church writings to the practice and doctrine of the modern British church, with the intention of equipping the Anglican layman to pursue intimacy with Christ.  A Dialogue Between a Methodist and a Churchman is one of Law's purely theological works. In it, Law engages what he sees as the most dangerous doctrines of Methodism using a dialectic format. The dialogue focuses especially on the Calvinistic doctrines of predestination and absolute depravity, and is remarkable for its extrapolation of Calvinist proof texts to refute the doctrines they allegedly prove.

As the play opens, King Henry IV (formerly Henry Bolingbroke) and Henry Percy (Hotspur) argue over the disposition of prisoners from the Battle of Holmedon. The King\u2019s attitude toward Mortimer and the Percy family prompts them to plot rebellion. In the meantime, his son Prince Hal is living the low life in the company of Sir John Falstaff. As the time of battle nears, Prince Hal joins his father and is given a high command. The play\u2019s climax is the Battle of Shrewsbury, in which Prince Hal and Hotspur meet and fight, with Prince Hal and the forces of the King prevailing. The action continues in King Henry IV, Part 2. From the start this has been an extremely popular play both with the public and with critics.

{"id": 650, "title": "folklore of the santal parganas, vol. 1", "description": "This is an intriguing collection of folklore from the Santal Parganas, a district in India located about 150 miles from Calcutta. As its preface implies, this collection is intended to give an unadulterated view of a culture through its folklore. It contains a variety of stories about different aspects of life, including family and marriage, religion, and work. In this first volume, taken from Part I, each story is centered around a particular human character. These range from the charmingly clever (as the character, The Oilman, in the story, \"The Oilman and His Sons\"), to the tragically comical (as the character, Jhore, in the story \"Bajun and Jhore\"). In later parts, the stories will focus on other subjects, including spirits, animals, and legends from this culture.", "num_sections": 25, "sections": {"22": {"number": 22, "name": "22 - Lita and His Animals", "url": "https://ia600202.us.archive.org/15/items/folklore_santal_parganas_0805_librivox/folklore_santal_parganas_23_bompas_64kb.mp3"}, "15": {"number": 15, "name": "15 -

One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers. The jokes seem fresh and witty even today.The three men were based on Jerome himself and two real-life friends, George, and Harris.

The account of Mowgli's adventures is followed by several short stories, including the tales of the brave white seal, Kotick, and the tenacious mongoose, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.

{"id": 663, "title": "oresteia", "description": "The Oresteia is a trilogy by Aeschylus, one of the foremost playwrights of ancient Greece. It encompasses three plays: Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Furies. It tells the tragic tale of the House of Atreus, whose inhabitants have been cursed and are doomed to play out their bloody, vengeful destinies. At the beginning of the first part, the Trojan War has ended and the Greek general, Agamemnon, is returning victorious to his wife Clytemnestra. Yet she finds it difficult to forgive his sacrifice of their daughter, Iphigenia, who was killed to ensure the Greek fleet fair winds in their voyage to Troy. Her desire for vengeance, and its dire consequences, instigates the action of these poetic tragedies.

{"id": 664, "title": "woman in white", "description": "The Woman in White is an epistolary novel written by Wilkie Collins in 1859, serialized in 1859-1860, and first published in book form in 1860. It is considered to be to the first mystery novel, and is widely regarded as one of the first (and finest) in the genre of \u2019sensation novels\u2019\u2026.The Woman in White is also an early example of a particular type of Collins narrative in which several characters in turn take up the telling of the story. This creates a complex web in which readers are unsure which narrator can, and cannot, be trusted. Collins used this technique in his other novels, including The Moonstone. This technique was copied by other novelists, including Bram Stoker, author of Dracula (1897), although by the end of the 19th century the technique was considered \u201cold-fashioned\u201d.

{"id": 670, "title": "federalist papers", "description": "The Federalist Papers (correctly known as The Federalist) are a series of 85 articles advocating the ratification of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of the essays were published serially in The Independent Journal and The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788 . A compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist, was published in 1788 by J. and A. M\u2019Lean.   The Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation of the Constitution, as they outline the philosophy and motivation of the proposed system of government.The authors of the Federalist Papers wanted to both influence the vote in favor of ratification and shape future interpretations of the Constitution. According to historian Richard Morris, they are an \"incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later

{"id": 679, "title": "age of innocence", "description": "In an era before the advent of electric lights, telephones or motor vehicles, there exists a small cluster of aristocratic \"old revolutionary stock\" families that rule New York's social life. Under the rules of this society, \"being things\" is better than \"doing things\" and reputation and outward appearances come at the exclusion of everything else. In this Gilded Age, when America\u2019s expansion and increased industrialism produce a group of newly wealthy robber barons and financiers, the patient, time-honored values of the old ruling class, and century, are giving way to the expediencies of the new. Caught at this cusp, a triangle of lovers, who must choose between the expectations of family and society, and the deepest yearnings of the heart.\nNewly engaged couple, Newland Archer, a young lawyer, and May Welland, a society debutante, are part of the old world, where the \"right people\" follow the \"correct rules\" and marry into \"acceptable families.\" The arrival from Europe of May\u2019s cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, complicates their union, as Ellen\u2019s mysterious past threatens to cast a shadow of scandal over the newly betrothed couple. Newland Archer, at first critical of Ellen's bohemian lifestyle, and her seemingly wilful ignorance of the rules and customs of his Old New York, is soon captivated by Ellen's warmth, spirit, and her generous and loving heart. Will he cast off the life for which he's been groomed, or sacrifice happiness for duty and the greater good of the social order?\n(Summary by Brenda Dayne)", "num_sections": 34, "sections": {"28":

{"id": 681, "title": "book of tea", "description": "The Book of Tea was written by Okakura Kakuzo in the early 20th century. It was first published in 1906, and has since been republished many times. - In the book, Kakuzo introduces the term Teaism and how Tea has affected nearly every aspect of Japanese culture, thought, and life. The book is noted to be accessibile to Western audiences because though Kakuzo was born and raised Japanese, he was trained from a young age to speak English; and would speak it all his life, becoming proficient at communicating his thoughts in the Western Mind. In his book he elucidates such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of Tea and Japanese life. The book emphasises how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that this tea-induced simplicity affected art and architecture, and he was a long-time student of the visual arts. He ends the book with a chapter on Tea Masters, and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyu and his contribution to the Japanese Tea Ceremony.

The plot involves the uncovering of secret German preparations for an invasion of the United Kingdom. It is often called the first modern spy novel, although others are as well, it was certainly very influential in the genre and for its time.\n\nThe book enjoyed immense popularity in the years before World War I and was extremely influential.

Volume I was published in 1776, and went through six printings (a remarkable feat for its time). Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, VI in 1788-89. The original volumes were published as quartos, a common publishing practice of the time.The books cover the period of the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius, from just before 180 to 1453 and beyond, concluding in 1590. They take as their material the behaviour and decisions that led to the decay and eventual fall of the Roman Empire in the East and West, offering an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.Gibbon is sometimes called the first \u201cmodern historian of ancient Rome.\u201d By virtue of its mostly objective approach and highly accurate use of reference material, Gibbon\u2019s work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19th and 20th century historians.

{"id": 690, "title": "iliad", "description": "The Iliad, together with the Odyssey, is one of two ancient Greek epic poems traditionally attributed to Homer. The poem is commonly dated to the 8th or 7th century BC, and many scholars believe it is the oldest extant work of literature in the Greek language, making it the first work of European literature. The existence of a single author for the poems is disputed as the poems themselves show evidence of a long oral tradition and hence, multiple authors. The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of Iliun, or Troy, by the Greeks.
